## General Information
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them at a higher price. The company wants to know :-

Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and*

How well those variables describe the price of a house.*
Based on various market surveys, the consulting firm has gathered a large dataset of different types of cars across the American market.




## Business Goal
Based on various market surveys, the consulting firm has gathered a large dataset of different types of cars across the American market.

Determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.

This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables

They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns.

The model will be a good way for the management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.

## Conclusions
- The Optimal lambda value in case of Ridge and Lasso are:-
   - Ridge - 100
   - Lasso - 0.002
   
- The Mean Squared error in case of Ridge and Lasso are :-
   - Ride - 0.112(on Test set)
   - Lasso - 0.112 ( on Test set)
   
- Ridge is only used to regularize to coefficient values while Lass  can   can be used in feature selection along with coefficients values.
